I made some updates to the post system in stacks.programming.dev to make it a bit
more organized. Categories will now be only the main sites and posts will be filtered
into what categories they fit best in. Previously each subdomain has its own category.

The main change for this would be that things like alternate frontends will be
under the Programming.Dev category instead of their own (but they still have a
tag for people who want to filter by only that subdomain)

Ive also cleaned up the posts to organize them better in the source code by appending
the date they were made in front of each ones file name and ive added some more
tags (such as an Alternate Frontend tag)
