Introducing the Programming.Dev community wiki. This is a place where communities can set up wiki pages for their communities to allow people to easily get info relating to it.

You can find the site [here](https://wiki.programming.dev)

## How does navigation work?

The home page has a list of communities with pages. If you click on a community it will bring you to their list of documents that you can look through.

Some possible use cases for a community wiki are: a code of conduct page, a frequently asked questions page, information about the community, credits if you need to credit things such as your community icon, a page for related communities, etc.

Ive set up a couple example pages to start. The gamedev section of the site has 6 different pages that you can look through to set some ideas

## How do I edit a page?

Editing is handled through git. Each page will have an edit this page button that will bring you to a page where you can fork the repository, make changes, and then make a pull request to get it accepted into the site.

The pages all reside in the content/docs folder while the sidebars are in content/menus. You can see how I set up some of the current pages for how to format things.

Pages are written in markdown.

## Are other languages supported?

Yes! Currently theres only english set up as we don't really have communities in other languages but it would be easy to add more language options in the site config.
