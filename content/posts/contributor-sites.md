We have a bunch more supporting sites for the instances that have been set up. All of these are contributor sites which means accounts on them are available to programming.dev contributors, donators, and/or admins.

## Vault

Vault is a password manager running vaultwarden. It will be used to pass along login details when setting up accounts for users on the various contributor sites since registration isnt opened. The link for it is https://vault.programming.dev.

## Files

Files is a site for file hosting and url shortening for then linking in places such as programming.dev. As an example heres a markdown file I added in https://files.programming.dev/u/9jsOS3.md and heres a link that redirects to an image http://files.programming.dev/go/meme.

Files can be given compression, a time it expires in, a maximum amount of views, and a password if you want to limit who can access it. The software used is Zipline.
