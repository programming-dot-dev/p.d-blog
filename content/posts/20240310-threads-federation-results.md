Its been a couple days which means I have the results of the threads federation poll we ran on the instance. The percentage difference between all of the options stayed relatively the same through the entire thing.

This was ran as ranked choice voting which means the least voted option gets eliminated every round and the votes for that option are distributed among the peoples second or third choices depending on if that was their first or second choice.

The total votes table shows the current votes for each option in each round. Differences shows the increase in votes the options gained from the last option being eliminated. Percentage shows the total % of votes the options have for each round.

Silenced was the first one to be eliminated with much less votes than everything else at 18 votes (aka 8.5%). Next up was limited being eliminated at 53 votes (25%). Out of the final two, blocked has the most amount of votes with around 55% of the vote total or 115 votes.

This means that threads will be fully defederated from on our instances. I will be running a poll again in around 6 months as a check in after threads has been federating for a bit to see if we want to change the decision or keep it.
