In the past we said we were going to run a federation poll regarding Threads (activitypub compatible instance created by meta) and now that theyre ramping up federation and we have a new instance coming that would interact with that I decided its time to do so

This poll is only open to people who have an account on programming.dev as it only affects those users (other instances decide federation on their own).

This also only affects us pulling content from them. Them pulling content from us isnt stoppable on our side (and if it is they can still get it through things such as boosts from instances in the middle on the microblog side or by querying the api).

There will be mention of a link aggregator side and a microblog side. The link aggregator side is the main programming.dev instance and the microblog side is a new instance being started up where I wanted to get this poll out before I release it publicly.

On the side of Threads they are making interacting using activitypub opt in so the amount of users there would not flood out everything else as people need to explicitly change in their settings that they want to interact with mastodon, etc.

Regardless of whats voted you shouldnt notice any changes on the link aggregator side similar to how mastodon users barely pop up now
