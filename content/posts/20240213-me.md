We have a brand new supporting site for the instances! Me.Programming.Dev is a place where you can see relevant links for things we host. Listed are software we are hosting, status pages, alternate frontends, and more.

You can find the site [here](https://me.programming.dev)

## Custom pages

The site is a self-hosted linkstack instance so as a little thank you towards donators, donators are able to get a custom page to put socials on. You can see an example of that over on my page at https://me.programming.dev/@Ategon. If you want a page and you've donated just reach out to me (Ategon).

## Adding links

As new instances and sites get made new links will be popping up over on the site. I recommend checking it out for new things every once in awhile just in case you miss an announcement on something new were releasing

## Whats this instance I don't recognize?

You may notice theres something we haven't announced yet on there. Left it in as a little early access for those reading our update posts before it releases later this week. Feel free to make an account and check it out before the floodgates open :)
