Hey everyone! Theres an event upcoming for the fediverse in 1 week (you can see the countdown from this site: https://canvas.fediverse.events/). This is an event similar to place and ran by the toast.ooo instance

Everyone has access to a shared pixel art canvas and can place a new pixel every so often! Pixels placed onto the map color that pixel the color you choose which every person then sees. People often coordinate with things like templates to get art of different things onto the map.

An example of canvas

Last year we participated and managed to get a pretty big zone for programming.dev. This year however will have much more participants than last year so need more support and help constructing our area. I'll be attempting to establish a technology zone on the canvas so if theres any instances or communities that have to do something with technology and want to do something feel free to reach out and we can help each other.

If you're interested in joining the event theres three locations we will be talking. Theres event channels on the [discord](https://discord.gg/SnUk3bKkNC) and [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#p.d:matrix.org) (that are bridged to each other). We also have an event community at https://programming.dev/c/events which most canvas posts will go in from now on. Hope to see you all there!

If you want to organize a section of the canvas for your community (e.g. c/godot) you can request a channel for your community on the [discord](https://discord.gg/SnUk3bKkNC) and [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#p.d:matrix.org) which will help you organize better. Feel free to reach out to me (Ategon).

If you want to help out the instance itself make sure to join the locations and things will be announced for updates. If you want to help organize things (organizing the instance for the event) feel free to reach out so I can get people to lead the pixel placing for things like when I'm sleeping.

The current design for this year

Should start making some more blog posts on stacks as I come back to be active in the instance again. Took a large-ish break to focus on some game dev and now back to power through things.
