Hi everyone! Were currently looking to get two new members of the community team: one for programming.dev (our forum and link aggregator) and one for bytes.programming.dev (our microblog)

Tasks would include making sure the community side of the instance runs smoothly so that people can enjoy the content on it

For programming.dev that would include helping with handling reports that come in, handling applications and making sure content hosted on the instance follows the CoC. For bytes it would be the same bar applications as bytes does not have an application process. You can see the full administration guidelines on our legal site here: https://legal.programming.dev/docs/administration-guidelines/. The primary communication platform for the admins is discord but all channels are also bridged to matrix

Anyone interested feel free to reach out to one of the team members listed in the administration guidelines (apart from snowe) or comment on the mirror of this post created on the programming.dev side (you can reach out on discord, matrix, programming.dev, or bytes)

The process for getting added onto the team would include an interview and permissions being added slowly to make sure new additions understand the guidelines and how they should be handling reports
