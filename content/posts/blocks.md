Introducing blocks.programming.dev! This is a site to add small code snippets you make for sharing easily in threads in programming.dev if you need to do something like put the same code in multiple spots.

The site is running using software called opengist and is essentially an equivalent to gists in github. Repo for it is here https://github.com/thomiceli/opengist.

Snippets are accessible both in the web interface and using git if you prefer adding in code from your text editor and then pushing it.

You can find the site here: https://blocks.programming.dev.
