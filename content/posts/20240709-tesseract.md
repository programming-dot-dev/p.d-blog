We now have a new alternate frontend for our instance, Tesseract!

Tesseract is a fork of Photon with some differences displayed on the [project's GitHub page](https://github.com/asimons04/tesseract).

The overall main features being:

- Full Media Support in Feed and Posts
- Community Browser / Enhanced Discovery
- Media Bias Fact Check (MBFC) Integration
- Fediseer Integration
- Distinguished and Sticky Comments
- Keyword Filtering
- Multiple Account Support
- Improved Moderation Tools

You can find the Tesseract frontend at https://t.programming.dev

Along with this, Photon is currently only semi-supported as opposed to being one of our main Alternate Frontends. Due to a recent swap in Photon's tooling we are unable to update to later versions of Photon. As such, for now the alternate frontend will exist frozen and will continue to exist in the future until either: a new lemmy version breaks that version of the frontend or the issues are fixed and upgrading becomes possible again.
