Hey everyone! I wanted to do a post here talking about an event going on in the fediverse called Lemmyvision. This is a competition where various communities each choose a song and then those are voted on by users to rank which ones people enjoy the most.

Its being ran as a fun way to see various kinds of music from around the world, sharing more between our online communities across Lemmy, and as a way to songs from lesser known artists. We are participating with game soundtracks as an opportunity to showcase new advancements in the game development space, especially for indie games that might otherwise not get much exposure.

There was a national final to determine the song our instance would submit in the [programming.dev event community](https://programming.dev/c/events). After voting the song [Your Inception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjeTwn9uA3Y) from the game Casette Beasts was chosen.

## Submitted Songs and Voting

Ive compiled all of the songs into playlists on three different platforms for watching

- [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJypTpbGxbErGJzqHlCdbb3rMFTcuFfOq)
- [Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1KRY3wAdYX8wejIaYnO30p)
- [Invidious Link](https://invidious.fdn.fr/playlist?list=PLJypTpbGxbErGJzqHlCdbb3rMFTcuFfOq)

Feel free to listen to them and vote using the voting link https://tally.so/r/nWNgKQ. When selecting what instance you are representing theres an option to select programming.dev for people voting from the instance.

Voting is done by ranking the songs from your favorite to your least favorite. Users from our instance can't rank the song we submitted to keep things fair.

If you want to chat with other people about the competition theres a community for it [here](https://programming.dev/c/lemmyvision@jlai.lu)

## Future Events

This post will be going into the meta community for people who might not know the event community exists (and i'll likely be doing another post when the event [Canvas](https://programming.dev/c/canvas@toast.ooo) is happening).

Any other future posts will be posted in the programming.dev event community. All major event posts will be made on our blog with the category set to the event name and the tag "Event".
